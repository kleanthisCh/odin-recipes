    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>:  A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>cooking Spray</strong>: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ul>
